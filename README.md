In a time where efficiency and sustainability take center stage, the demand for intelligent
solutions to manage home energy consumption has never been more urgent. Home
automation presents an enticing opportunity, not just for added convenience, but also for
optimizing energy usage. In this introduction, we explore the fusion of ESP32 and Arduino
Uno microcontrollers to craft a sophisticated energy monitoring system. This setup empowers
users to monitor current, power, and voltage consumption in real-time while utilizing the
ESP32's capabilities to control the activation and deactivation of four loads through PIR
(Passive Infrared) sensors. This integration not only provides valuable insights for smarter
energy management but also offers the convenience of automating device operation based on
occupancy detection.
